title: The L-word

I once updated my `XING` profile in the `Haves` section, with the tag `"Leading a team"`. For those of you unfamiliar with `XING`, the `Haves` and `Wants` section of a `XING` profile is similar to to the skills section from `Linkedin` albeit minus the endorsements. When I looked the next time at my profile, the autofilling wizard suggested to me that instead of `"Leading"` I could also use `"Zeilendurchschuss"`.

Turns out that `"Leading"` also has a very special meaning in typography (where it typically refers to the distance between adjacent lines of type). It also resulted in glorious 5 minutes of rofl-ing with some of our data science colleagues (who instantly knew what was going on there). 

I thought that was pretty funny. Anyway, the topic for today is of course not `"Zeilendurchschuss"`, but `Leading` as in `Leadership` or `Leading software engineering teams`. This is going to be a bit more personal posts than the previous ones, because we will also dive how I had to re-build myself in order to be able to lead the way I wanted (as opposed how typical companies view leadership) and the struggles that I went through doing so.

If it sounds in some parts like it does, it has more to do with my lack of skill in writing in a foreign language than anything else.

That being said, let's get to it.

# You keep using that word. I don't think it means what you think it means

From my experience in day to day work the word `"Leadership"` is more often than not used synonymous to `"Management"`. It sometimes seems that `"Management"` as a word is on some blacklist. A word that seemingly reminds us of the old, the type of company we don't want to be any more, with tayloristic separation between the people who decide what to do and the others that do the actual work.  







Ever heard of `"Leadership team"` as another term for team of managers? What these people usually mean when they say `"Leader"` is decision maker in the traditional sense or someone who's accountable for a group of people in the company. 

The thing though for me is that `"Leadership"` can come from a lot of places.

# How I lead 
When I'm asked to describe how I lead, I often use an analogy to describe my primary assumptions. All analogies break at some point and become of limited use

- Modern sports team metaphor
  - metaphors are never perfect and they break in more places than people (including myself) are usually aware

  - let's talk about the hard truths about leading
    - Ultimately all mostly matters are (short term) results. 
    - It doesn't matter whether the squad played beautiful to watch football, when it doesn't score and repeatedly looses you're eventually going to be sacked as a head coach or manager
    - Even if you play beautiful, have an overall successful season but fail in the playoffs or finals, there's a high chance that you're going to get sacked
    - On the other hand when you're games are shit to watch, but you keep on winning somehow, maybe even the championship, well you already know the answer.
    - It feels brutal sometimes that all the effort you put into culture, development of people, estabilishing good working relationships, paving the way for mid- to long-term goals, all of this is a second class citizen compared to results.
    - But that's the way it usually is, it's not personal, it's simply business.

  - let's talk about game philosophy
    - have you compared footage of old games 20 years ago with newer football games?
    - difference in speed
    - difference in dynamic of roles
    - difference in necessary adaptability 
    - fast and good decisions require 
      - players with situational awareness
      - an understanding of the overall context
      - the ability to execute without getting the 'ok' from the boss
      - lots and lots of training so that these reactions are followed naturally and automatically

  - the best team wins, not the one with the best players
  
  - being successful for a longer period
    - requires a constant invest in people
    - requires reinventing yourself
    - requires to a certain degree making sure that the success of the team is not coupled to individual people
    - example mourinho

  - Let's talk about managers and head coaches in general
    - past players often attempt to become managers, few are really good at it
    - being a head coach is a significanltly different job
    - the danger of a playing coach
    - but it requires being grounded in that particular sport (have you ever seen a football coach working in basketball?)
