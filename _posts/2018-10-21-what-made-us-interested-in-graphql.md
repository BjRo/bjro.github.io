One thing that's often missing in a lot of the heated `GraphQL` vs. `REST` articles you find everywhere nowadays, is shedding a bit light on the personal motives of the people opting to use `GraphQL`. Mine go back roughly 6 years.

I started working for `XING` in 2012. A radical technological and cultural switch for me at the time. Prior to working for `XING` I was primarily writing software on Windows machines, in `C#` / `.NET`. Some of them were pure desktop applications, other were client server applications. Remember `Web Services`, `SOAP`, `WCF` and friends. Yep, that sea of pain was I was primarily using at the time. For a time I was working in the medical environment, later then for insurances, then a company in the chemical area and then again medical enviroment. Ultimately the Microsoft environment started to kill my passion for building software. After years of "this is not from Microsoft, we ain't going to use it", "open source are you kidding me?", "writing tests for my code? Na, I'm not a tester" and ultimately the nail on the coffin in a discussion with a developer evangelist from `Microsoft` itself at the time "Visual Studio will have feature XYZ. Why should we do that? Forget about it. You're not our target group!". So I decided to do a reboot.
