I once updated my `XING` profile in the `Haves` section, with the tag `"Leading a team"`. For those of you unfamiliar with `XING`, the `Haves` and `Wants` section of a `XING` profile is similar to to the skills section from `Linkedin` albeit minus the endorsements. When I looked the next time at my profile, the autofilling wizard suggested to me that instead of `"Leading"` I could also use `"Zeilendurchschuss"`.

Turns out that `"Leading"` also has a very special meaning in typography (where it typically refers to the distance between adjacent lines of type). 

It also resulted in glorious 5 minutes of laugh fest with some of our data science colleagues (who instantly knew what was going on there). Anyway, the topic of today is not `"Zeilendurchschuss"`, but I'd like to use the opportunity and talk a bit more about my personal views on leadership especially in the context of leading software engineers.

- Don't know how they want to lead
- Unwritten sheet of paper
- Approaching leadership like I had approached engineering before

- Modern sports team metaphor
  - metaphors are never perfect and they break in more places than people (including myself) are usually aware

  - let's talk about the hard truths about leading
    - Ultimately all mostly matters are (short term) results. 
    - It doesn't matter whether the squad played beautiful to watch football, when it doesn't score and repeatedly looses you're eventually going to be sacked as a head coach or manager
    - Even if you play beautiful, have an overall successful season but fail in the playoffs or finals, there's a high chance that you're going to get sacked
    - On the other hand when you're games are shit to watch, but you keep on winning somehow, maybe even the championship, well you already know the answer.
    - It feels brutal sometimes that all the effort you put into culture, development of people, estabilishing good working relationships, paving the way for mid- to long-term goals, all of this is a second class citizen compared to results.
    - But that's the way it usually is, it's not personal, it's simply business.

  - let's talk about game philosophy
    - have you compared footage of old games 20 years ago with newer football games?
    - difference in speed
    - difference in dynamic of roles
    - difference in necessary adaptability 
    - fast and good decisions require 
      - players with situational awareness
      - an understanding of the overall context
      - the ability to execute without getting the 'ok' from the boss
      - lots and lots of training so that these reactions are followed naturally and automatically
  
  - being successful for a longer period
    - requires a constant invest in people
    - requires reinventing yourself
    - requires to a certain degree making sure that the success of the team is not coupled to individual people
    - example mourinho

  - Let's talk about managers and head coaches in general
    - past players often attempt to become managers, few are really good at it
    - being a head coach is a significanltly different job
    - the danger of a playing coach
    - but it requires being grounded in that particular sport (have you ever seen a football coach working in basketball?)

  - So what does this all mean?
    - works on the broader system level (where the system is the organisation)
    - has an understanding of flow within the system
    - removes obstacles and impediments so that flow can happen in the system
    - sets the bar on culture
