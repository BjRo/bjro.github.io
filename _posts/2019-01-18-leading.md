I once updated my `XING` profile in the `Haves` section, with the tag `"Leading a team"`. For those of you unfamiliar with `XING`, the `Haves` and `Wants` section of a `XING` profile is similar to to the skills seciton from `Linkedin` albeit minus the endorsements. When I looked the next time at my profile, the autofilling wizard suggested to me that instead of `"Leading"` I could also use `"Zeilendurchschuss"`.

Turns out that `"Leading"` also has a very special meaning in typography (where it typically refers to the distance between adjacent lines of type). It also resulted in glorious 5 minutes of laugh fest with some of our data science colleagues (who instantly knew what was going on there). Anyway, the topic of today is not `"Zeilendurchschuss"`, but I'd like to use the opportunity and talk a bit more about my personal views on leadership especially in the context of leading software engineers.
