title: On adaptive Software Design
---
I've participated in efforts to deliver software for more than 15 years now. The first five using the good old waterfall approach with infrequent, big releases; the last 10 years in teams that followed one of the flavors of the agile method. 

Some of the teams I was working on were using `Scrum`,  others used `Kanban`, some used a mixture of both. The worst application of the agile method I encountered in the last 10 years is what I would generally describe as `Agile without a soul` or like Martin Fowler calls it, [faux-agile](https://martinfowler.com/articles/agile-aus-2018.html).  You know, the version that heavily focuses on the prescriptive process portions; which has teams whose members aren't on eye level because the Product Owner actually turns out to be a manager in disguise; where removal of impediments and/or continuous improvement is seen similarly often as unicorns. The only thing that does turn out to be continuous is the nagging sentiment in higher management levels that "This Agile thing is fraud and hurts us more than it actually helps". 

> Well at least with the capital A version of agile, they're probably right with that assessment

But guess what, I've seen the unicorn already twice in my career. I've seen highly productive, self organized software engineering teams that took an impressive leap from where they were before using agile practices to where they ended up being. And I'm still a believer. 

For the majority of the last two years I've been working in a team that only consists of developers. No Product Owners, no project manager, no agile coach, no business analysts, nothing. We were doing everything that was necessary to make our software successful, ranging from developing trainings for it, creating developer focused documentation, organizing stakeholder meetings, running retrospectives with the teams that are using our software,and many other things. Before writing this I hadn't heard of the term, but apparently [Fred Georges coined a similar setup Programmer Anarchy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk-CF7klLdA).
