The last time around I shed some light on why `GraphQL` was appealing to me for sorting out our API game. It would have been easy after the project was green lit just to directly dive into the technical challenges. 

But if there's one thing that several years of work in larger companies have taught me, then it's that most of the time projects don't fail for technical reasons. There are so many non-technical influences that can derail a project. 

Just to name a few: 

* Overcommitting
* having a slightly different understanding about the project goal on different levels
* being crushed in internal politics or power struggles
* in-transparency because of half-baked project communication
* addressing risk too late in a project
* trying to stick to fixed plan that doesn't work in reality 

and probably many many more. 

I always viewed this project as a golden opportunity to do something truly great on our platform. To right some past wrongs. To enable the platform to take a productivity leap where previously tiny steps where the norm. That's why I didn't want to go naive into the project and tried to do everything I could personally do, to make sure this one's going to be a success.

# We need a name for this
My boss at the time had already made up his mind about the project name. He wanted to call the project "Everest", because another project to establish a PAAS via Kubernetes named "Olympus" had been started earlier. I hated that name from the moment I heard it. Especially given that people have died trying to ascend that mountain. And also, to be frank, because I already had a name for this in mind: "XING One". Luckily I managed to convince him that this one would be a better choice.

Most of the people at my current company know the name, but only very few know where the name originated. Some colleagues think it comes from "Lord of the Rings" (ala the one API to rule them all), but this isn't the case. It's a nod to the book [American Icon](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13132620-american-icon) which recounts the story of how Allan Mulally managed save and turn around the Ford Motor Company during the early 2000s. It's a remarkable story of what an aligned team with a shared goal and a clear mission can achieve. Mulallys misson statement for their turnaround strategy was "One team, One plan, One Goal".

I loved that. It's simple, memorable and uniting. With that it sets the tone for collaboration and culture. It's not surprising that our version is a derivation of that mission statement.
