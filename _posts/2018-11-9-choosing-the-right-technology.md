title: Choosing the right technology for XING One
---
Figuring out what technology to use for a large scale, long term project is never an easy feat. 8 years ago `XING` was pretty much only using `Perl` and `Ruby (on Rails)` in the backend. In 2017 we had plenty of options to choose from: `Java`, `Scala`, `Elixir`, `Go`, `PHP` and `Ruby`. Most of them offer `GraphQL` implementations. 

So how do you skin that cat?

First of all, I made the conscious decision not to make my personal skills or the widespread availability of knowhow within `XING` a trumping factor in the decision. 

I had successfully delivered products and projects in `Ruby` and `Elixir` within `XING` and a longer history with `C#` before that. I even had done [Martin Oderskys Functional Programming Principles in Scala course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1) in my free-time one or two years prior to the project. All in all, I was confident enough that I would manage to get proficient enough to deliver in any programming language if I really had to. 

I also felt that our project shouldn't be restricted by heritage and that we should pick the best solution for the company with a forward oriented mindset. If I were to base the decision predominantly on the availability of knowhow within `XING`, the answer would involuntarily lead me to `Ruby`, which is still the most used technology stack within our company in 2018. But I had my doubts whether `Ruby` would be a good implementation choice for our proxy.

"Opinions", "doubts", let's be honest, we're all more or less biased one way or another. I definitely know I was biased when it came to certain technologies I had used before (at the time I was a heavy advocate for `Elixir` for example). But I thought it was a good idea to counter balance that bias through a more transparent and structured selection process.

# Enter the Premortem
Some months prior, I had read [Decisive by Chip and Dan Heath](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15798078-decisive) and one of the tools that was described in there, was a `Premortem`. In a nutshell a `Premortem` is the hypothetical opposite of a `Postmortem`: You don't analyze the failure after the fact, but instead hypothesize what could turn the project into a spectacular failure and then ask the simple questions of **"Why?"** and **"What would I have done about it, if I had known earlier?"**. 

Done collaboratively it allows you to surface risk and brainstorm detection and mitigation strategies from multiple viewpoints in the earlier phases of an initiative. Those phases when you can still do something about it. Of course this doesn't rule out `Black Swans`, the [unknown unknowns](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_known_knowns), but it certainly helps to form the right mindset: To be proactive, instead of reactive. Since it was only me back then, I mostly used my boss as the sparring partner for the `Premortem`, which also helped me to understand the project from a management perspective better. 

> We did another larger `Premortem` for our rollout strategy into the company. I'll show this in a separate blog post, because this one contained one  additional element that I find fascinating: Tripwires, or how you would know when something is actually starting to happen.

You don't need some sophisticated tech for this. Our first version was an `Excel` sheet that was later moved to `Confluence` for documentation purposes. To give you some general idea how this might look like, ours kinda looked like this:

# The checklist
You probably know this famous quote from Yogi Berra: **"In theory there is no difference between theory and practice. In practice there is."**. During the `Premortem` phase we developed strong hunch that the technology decision for `XING One` needed to contain some decent amount of hands-on coding in the respective options. 

Because of that we decided to do something that was unusual and uncommon for technology projects at `XING` (and to my knowledge still is): __We spend the first 1,5 months actually implementing a throwaway prototype of our idea in all the relevant technologies__

We extracted all gaps of knowledge and risks we surfaced in the `Premortem` that could be validated in the prototyping phase into a simple checklist. You can see those in the screenshot above in the "Prototype relevant" column. 

In the end the shortlist of candidates for our prototyping phase were:

* `Ruby` with [graphql-ruby](https://github.com/rmosolgo/graphql-ruby)
* `Javascript` with [graphql-js](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js) and [apollo-server](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server)
* `Elixir` with [absinthe](https://github.com/absinthe-graphql/absinthe)
* and `Scala` with [Sangria](https://github.com/sangria-graphql/sangria)

How did we end up with those? The reason for this is two-fold. First, we made a pre-requisite that for every technology stack option we would require at least some minimal in-house production experience. This was primarily intended as a fallback scenario when our problem solving or troubleshooting skills hit an impasse.

Second, we didn't want to to have deep integration into our monitoring and deployment infrastructure in the critical project path. (I was just coming of a stint in our messenger product where I spend 1,5 months of building integration with our in-house messaging system for `Elixir`)

Our checklist contained an example schema, 3 different `GraphQL` queries and 1 `GraphQL` mutation to execute against the server. That was primarily for observing and comparing the execution behavior, but also to get a decent understanding how a `GraphQL` server in general works. 

On top of that it contained a whole bunch of other things to investigate: 

* Which of our general assumptions about `GraphQL` turn out to be false already at this stage?
* Does the `GraphQL` implementation tick more like a library or a framework?
* How easy is it to customize behavior here and there?
* How good is the documentation?
* How active and inclusive are the maintainers?
* How easy is it to get changes in when necessary?
* As a gut feeling how big is the part that we need to build on top and what was our gut feeling whether we could pull this of?

I wrote the prototypes for `Ruby`, `Scala` and `Javascript`. During the third week of the prototyping phase [Alexis Mas](https://www.xing.com/profile/Alexis_Mas/cv) joined the project, coming over from a different part of the company (together with the rest of our old API infrastructure). He build the `Elixir` prototype. And finally I wasn't alone in this anymore.

We had planned to use only 1 month for the evaluation. In the end it took us 1,5 months. The net result of the prototyping phase can be seen in the following two pictures. The symbols you see in the checklist follow the following scheme:

Please note that your looking at the summary overview. Internally a longer descriptive version of this still exists in the documentation of the project.

> I'm pretty certain that our conclusions might be not be shared by some folks out there. We tried hard to make them somewhat transparent and comprehensible, but they still contain subjective impressions. But hey, companies are different and not everyone might arrive at the same conclusions coming from different contexts.

>Please also note that we were doing this evaluation in __February 2017__. Some implementations, `Apollo` in particular, have made a larger jump in their capabilities. Re-doing the evaluation today might result in a slightly different ranking. I doubt though, that the top spot for us would be different.

# Why we chose Sangria
In the end `Sangria`, the `Scala` solution, turned out to be our favorite. It collected many plus points during the prototyping phase:

* The [documentation](https://sangria-graphql.org/learn/) was top-notch
* Conceptually, it quacked more like a library than a framework. As a consequence it was fairly easy to change and extend the behavior of the `GraphQL` engine. Even better, a lot of those extension points also had high quality documentation. 
* The concurrency capabilities of the platform looked like a good fit for our proxy scenario and `Sangria` provided a lot of interesting batching and execution options out of the box. 
* Some features were already implemented in `Sangria` that were still being discussed in the `GraphQL` community at the time and lacking in some of the other implementations (for instance the complexity analysis or SDL based schema materialization)

Last but not least, I had a good gut feeling about `Sangria` as an open source project itself. In the short contacts and brief online interactions I had with its maintainer [Oleg Ilyenko](https://github.com/OlegIlyenko) I was amazed how knowledgable and at the same time humble and helpful he was. My impression was that if we would ever run into dead-ends with `Sangrias` code, for most scenarios we wouldn't have to run a fork, simply because of `Sangrias` extensibility. And for the other cases where this wasn't true, we could work with him to bring the necessary changes to `Sangria`. This gut feeling turned out to be true multiple times and I think this is also one of the reasons for the success of `Sangria` and why especially bigger companies seem to be betting on it. I'll write a bit more about that aspect in future posts, promised :)

Choosing `Sangria` is one of those decisions that I've never regretted. I never even once looked back thinking "This would be so much easier|better|cooler in XYZ". We're still happy with that choice, even after roughly 1,5 years of working with it. And you will see in the following posts, that our usage of `Sangria` is, well, a bit unconventional (to say the least). 

In the next post I will talk a bit about the initial game plan we derived from the `Premortem` and prototyping phase. Remember, in the last post, I mentioned that we were simultaneously building a new version of the profile with the respective product team. But so far we didn't have a single line of code written (since we archived the prototypes and started again from scratch). Obviously we had some stuff to figure out at that stage. 

I hope you enjoyed this. See you next time around!!!
