title: The game has changed
---
If you compare modern football teams to their predecessors 20-30 years ago, I think you can spot some interesting differences. Taking a look at the typical players for instance it seems to me that they were much more stereotypical than today. 

* Goalies prevented the goals, but everyone got nervous when they had the ball at their foot. 

* Defenders were mostly about destroying the opponents game, participating in the game with the ball itself came second. Think of JÃ¼rgen Kohler for example.

* Creative mid-fielders and strikers were often completely freed of any defensive responsibilities. And we often had single players that dominated the games. (We still have Messi and Ronaldo, but they're probably the exception). Some famous midf-fielders or strikers were even smokers (Mario Basler anyone?)
  
In a nutshell teams were composed of highly specialized people focusing on their respective duties. If memory serves me right, I also remember much more independent actions in the past and the system that squads were playing back in the days was pretty static compared to today.

One thing seem to have changed in the last decades: The game has become [much faster](https://90soccer.com/how-the-sport-of-soccer-has-changed-over-the-years/)and [more intense](http://sciencenordic.com/scientists-football-has-changed-dramatically), requiring much [more fitness](https://www.grassrootscoaching.com/how-the-game-of-football-has-evolved-over-the-last-20-years-part-one/), [more collaboration and faster reaction times](https://www.grassrootscoaching.com/how-the-game-of-football-has-evolved-over-the-last-20-years-part-two/).

Just to name a few stats I dug up via Google

* Players do cover around 50% more distance in a game than 20 years ago
* The amount of sprinting and high-intensity playing activities (like sprints) has doubled since the year 2002
* The ball is in play, and live, for almost 15 minutes (17%) longer than was the case in 1990

As a consequence the squads we're seeing today play the game radically different to what I was used seeing in my youth. Gone are the high specializations of the past. 

* Goalies need to be good with the ball, 
* Defenders are often the ones who open up a counter attack either over the wings or through the center. 
* The offensive that's freed from all defensive duties is pretty much gone. Defensive is now starting at the frontline. Mid-fielders and strikers do have to play their role in it.

All of them need to be highly trained athletes in order to be able to compete at highest level. Gone are the smokers of the past. And another fascinating thing seems to have changed: The dynamics between the coach at the sidelines, the system and the players on the field.

Now with the game being so fast, decision making solely happens on the field. Players need to thoroughly understand their role in the larger context, their expected behavior in certain situations and their options for adapting when situations arise that weren't on the preparation sheet. They have to, so that they can make these split second decisions that make or brake the game without a lot external sign-off.

If you ever watched a top squad from the higher ranks of a stadium, you'd also probably realized the magnificent coordination that seems to happen intuitively. Gone are the static positions in the past. You see coordinated changes of the system in offense and defense depending on the game situation. Obviously it's not intuitive, it has been trained to the excess into the squad, but sometimes it looks to easy and natural that it has the feeling of intuitiveness.

# So why am I writing about this?

I find that fascinating and beautiful. When I was looking for inspiration on how I wanted to lead an engineering team, I peeked into all sorts of disciplines and professions. Besides the typical management literature two areas that you often end up at are competitive, squad based sports and the military. And I usually prefer the former. 

I see a lot of similarities between the increased need for delivering faster to customers, iterating faster on our product while maintaining or even increasing the quality of the delivered product in the IT world and the development I described earlier about football. I think that you can derive some broader principles and deeper understanding about teams and on how to lead a team from this that can have a dramatic impact on the perceived performance of the team. At least it had a dramatic insight for me. 

>A lot of the insights I'm going to touch on next are probably worth their own detailed look. I'm leaving this for other posts though to see if there's enough interest and justified.
