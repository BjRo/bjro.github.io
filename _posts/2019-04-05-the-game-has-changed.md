title: The game has changed
---
If you compare modern football teams to their predecessors 20-30 years ago, I think you can spot some interesting differences. Taking a look at the typical players for instance it seems to me that they were much more stereotypical than today. 

* Goalies prevented the goals, but everyone got nervous when they had the ball at their foot. 

* Defenders were mostly about destroying the opponents game, participating in the game with the ball itself came second. Think of JÃ¼rgen Kohler for example.

* Creative mid-fielders and strikers were often completely freed of any defensive responsibilities. And we often had single players that dominated the games. (We still have Messi and Ronaldo, but they're probably the exception). Some famous midf-fielders or strikers were even smokers (Mario Basler anyone?)
  
In a nutshell teams were composed of highly specialized people focusing on their respective duties. If memory serves me right, I also remember much more independent actions in the past and the system that squads were playing back in the days was pretty static compared to today.

One thing seem to have changed in the last decades: The game has become [much faster](https://90soccer.com/how-the-sport-of-soccer-has-changed-over-the-years/) and [more intense](http://sciencenordic.com/scientists-football-has-changed-dramatically), requiring [much   more fitness](https://www.grassrootscoaching.com/how-the-game-of-football-has-evolved-over-the-last-20-years-part-one/), [more collaboration and faster reaction times](https://www.grassrootscoaching.com/how-the-game-of-football-has-evolved-over-the-last-20-years-part-two/).

Just to name a few stats I dug up via Google

* Players do cover around 50% more distance in a game than 20 years ago
* The amount of sprinting and high-intensity playing activities (like sprints) has doubled since the year 2002
* The ball is in play, and live, for almost 15 minutes (17%) longer than was the case in 1990

As a consequence the squads we're seeing today play the game radically different to what I was used seeing in my youth. Gone are the high specializations of the past. 

* Goalies need to be good with the ball, 
* Defenders are often the ones who open up a counter attack either over the wings or through the center. 
* The offensive that's freed from all defensive duties is pretty much gone. Defensive is now starting at the frontline. Mid-fielders and strikers do have to play their role in it.

All of them need to be highly trained athletes in order to be able to compete at highest level. Gone are the smokers of the past. And another fascinating thing seems to have changed: The dynamics between the coach at the sidelines, the system and the players on the field.

Now with the game being so fast, decision making solely happens on the field. Players need to thoroughly understand their role in the larger context, their expected behavior in certain situations and their options for adapting when situations arise that weren't on the preparation sheet. They have to, so that they can make these split second decisions that make or brake the game without a lot external sign-off.

If you ever watched a top squad from the higher ranks of a stadium, you'd also probably realized the magnificent coordination that seems to happen intuitively. Gone are the static positions in the past. You see coordinated changes of the system in offense and defense depending on the game situation. Obviously it's not intuitive, it has been trained to the excess into the squad, but sometimes it looks to easy and natural that it has the feeling of intuitiveness.

# So why am I writing about this?

I find that fascinating and beautiful. When I was looking for inspiration on how I wanted to lead an engineering team, I peeked into all sorts of disciplines and professions. Besides the typical management literature two areas that you often end up at are competitive, squad based sports and the military. And I usually prefer the former. 

I see a lot of similarities between the increased need for delivering faster to customers, iterating faster on our product while maintaining or even increasing the quality of the delivered product in the IT world and the development I described earlier about football. 

I think that you can derive some broader principles and deeper understanding about teams and on how to lead a team from this that can have a dramatic impact on the performance of the team. At least it had dramatic insights for me and shaped how I'm running my team for the last 2 years. 

>A lot of the insights I'm going to touch on next are probably worth their own detailed look. I'm leaving this for other posts though to see if there's enough interest and effort of jotting them down is justified.

## There is no such thing as "enough transparency"
A lot about what is perceived as performance often (but not always) boils down to speed of making decisions. In order to be able to make the adequate ones, I think you need proper context. You need to have a thorough understanding of the "Why?" in order to derive the "What?" and the "How?". And usually there are plenty of "What?"s and "How?"s.

Some managers work with information, but wherever I can I try to make as much information available to my team as possible, the good ones and the bad ones, so that the proper decisions have a chance to be formed within the team. I also learned that there's quite a bit of loyalty involved when you're open about the negative and not working things from the start. Some applicants thought I was trying to talk them out of an open position when in fact I was being transparent about what working in my team compared to working to what he/she was used to. But the ones that took it on are still with me, even if it has been stressful sometimes.

## Explicit almost always wins over implicit
Some people do get pleasure from being the sole point for authority of their area and that all important decisions have to be acknowledged by them. I'm not one of those people. On the contrary I think it hinders day to day team performance when someone when an engineering lead or manager is asked for permission on all sorts of things. 

As the enemies of Admiral Nelson in the [battle of Trafalgar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Trafalgar) found out, things get slightly messy when you're relying on a central authority which is not available and the rest of the gang is suddenly without direction.

Similarly in the pitch as a player, you can't wait for someone else to make decisions for you, you're forced to make the decisions yourself under time pressure. 

The point here is that the more information you've got available and the clearer your picture is on what your responsibility and authority is, the faster the decisions will likely happen.

I've used [Delegation Poker and Delegation Boards](https://management30.com/practice/delegation-poker/) to sort out and clarify decision making with success in the last 2 years and it feels right and natural to me. 

## Generalists over specialists
The engineers in my team are jotting and discussing requirements, implement features in multiple programing languages (we've used `Scala`, `Ruby` and a bit of `Go` in the last 2 years), doing QA, giving workshops and internal trainings, organizing all major agile-ish meetings (like groomings, retros), talking to customer teams (we're building an internal developer oriented product) and many other things. 

There's no `Product Owner` in my team, no `Project Manager`, no `Agile Coach` or `Scrum Master`. They simply do everything themselves. 

Funny side effect of this, is that they seem to support each better than any specialist team I've worked with in the past. Does it mean that everybody is awesome in everything? No, but we're all improving in multiple dimensions and it's a pleasure to see how this group adapts to new situations as a group.

An in the face of a more fast paced world around us, I believe we need exactly that. Teams that are able to adapt and change gears quickly, that are not afraid of loosing their past investments when going into an area where are they're not the expert anymore. For me that's true agility.

## Constant inspection, feedback and tinkering creates highly performing teams
## Start with frameworks (if you have to), but in the end following principles is more beneficial
## Prepare similarly for expected as also unexpected situations 
## You can sprint, but not forever
## Realize that you're measured by results only
## Embrace that we're all on a way to somewhere
Like players in the pitch, there's high demand for really great IT professionals on the market. You can try to fight that, but you can also choose to embrace that. Allow your team to be in the spotlight wherever possible. Give the thing you're working on actual faces that people can relate too. Increase their marked value. Aim for having a good and successful time together. Because eventually like all good times in life, things will come to an end. One or more of you are going to leave. That's normal and fine. But the relationships stick and your team culture and spirit might also be preserved even when you're not part of it any more.


# Closing thoughts

Things have become noticeably faster and ever changing compared to 10 or 20 years ago in our profession. Decide for yourself what this means for knowledge work and collaboration. If you're trying to fight this with yesterdays management strategies, I believe you're not that far away from a loosing streak.

In the end of course all metaphors and analogies break down, but that doesn't mean they're completely useless. I use them as guiding principles that drive the way I make decisions and approach work together with my team. Am I perfectly following all of them? No, that would be cocky and full of hubris. But I try to follow them wherever I can. 

If you've got questions on this, feel free to connect with me on Twitter. My handle is [@bjoernrochel](https://twitter.com/bjoernrochel). I hoped this was somewhat useful to read. At the very least it was for me for structuring my thoughts regarding this.

See you next time around!
